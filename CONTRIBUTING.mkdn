# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

Thank you for considering contributing to this distribution.  This file
contains instructions that will help you work with the source code.

The distribution is managed with Dist::Zilla.  This means than many of the
usual files you might expect are not in the repository, but are generated at
release time, as is much of the documentation.  Some generated files are
kept in the repository as a convenience (e.g. Makefile.PL or cpanfile).

Generally, **you do not need Dist::Zilla to contribute patches**.  You may need
Dist::Zilla to create a tarball.  See below for guidance.

## Getting dependencies

If you have App::cpanminus 1.6 or later installed, you can use `cpanm` to
satisfy dependencies like this:

    $ cpanm --installdeps .

Otherwise, look for either a `Makefile.PL` or `cpanfile` file for
a list of dependencies to satisfy.

## Running tests

You can run tests directly using the \`prove\` tool:

    $ prove -l
    $ prove -lv t/some_test_file.t

For most of my distributions, \`prove\` is entirely sufficient for you to test any
patches you have. I use \`prove\` for 99% of my testing during development.

## Code style and tidying

Please try to match any existing coding style.  If there is a `.perltidyrc`
file, please install Perl::Tidy and use perltidy before submitting patches.

## Patching documentation

Much of the documentation Pod is generated at release time.  Some is
generated boilerplate; other documentation is built from pseudo-POD
directives in the source like `=method` or `=func`.

If you would like to submit a documentation edit, please limit yourself to
the documentation you see.

If you see typos or documentation issues in the generated docs, please
email or open a bug ticket instead of patching.

## Installing and using DistZilla

Dist::Zilla is a very powerful authoring tool, optimized for maintaining a
large number of distributions with a high degree of automation, but it has a
large dependency chain, a bit of a learning curve and requires a number of
author-specific plugins.

To install it from CPAN, I recommend one of the following approaches for
the quickest installation:

    # using CPAN.pm, but bypassing non-functional pod tests
    $ cpan TAP::Harness::Restricted
    $ PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 HARNESS_CLASS=TAP::Harness::Restricted cpan Dist::Zilla

    # using cpanm, bypassing *all* tests
    $ cpanm -n Dist::Zilla

In either case, it's probably going to take about 10 minutes.  Go for a walk,
go get a cup of your favorite beverage, take a bathroom break, or whatever.
When you get back, Dist::Zilla should be ready for you.

Then you need to install any plugins specific to this distribution:

    $ cpan `dzil authordeps`
    $ dzil authordeps | cpanm

Once installed, here are some dzil commands you might try:

    $ dzil build
    $ dzil test
    $ dzil xtest

You can learn more about Dist::Zilla at http://dzil.org/

# OTHER SHORTCUTS

I use a few other tricks that might prove useful to know about when hacking
on my dists.

## Install and Test using a pre-made build branch

Most of my repositories come with 1 or more pre-made `build` branches, which may
occur under any of the following names:

- `builds` - my last `dzil build`
- `releases` - the build generated for the most recent CPAN release
- `build/master` ( _legacy_ version of `builds` )

These branches contain committed copies of my own local `dzil build` invocations.

Checking out a copy of these branches with

    git checkout builds

Will get you a full working built tree, which will look identical to how the distribution
will look once I ship it.

Having this is not entirely necessary as you should be able to do similar simply working
on the master branch ( with a few caveats around POD handling )

But its there if you need it.

Additionally: These branches are part of my Travis testing infrastructure which help
ascertain that the module will work and pass tests without the benefit of having
3-halves of CPAN due to developer dependencies.

## Locally Patch dist ini

The majority of `Dist::Zilla` authors ship around a load of shared configuration
in a personal `@Bundle`, which makes replicating configuration to their different
distributions simpler.

This has a downside that every time they make a minor tweak to their bundle, everywhere
that was currently using that bundle gets the changes, and not all those changes will
necessarily work with their code.

The bundle system also makes it tricky for people to simply patch-out single plugins
that are causing local problems for them because they're hidden behind the bundle fa√ßade.

Here, I use a system from generating a frozen snapshot of the state of my bundle:
`dist.ini` is a flattened unbundled version of `dist.ini.meta`

As such, you can tell **exactly** which plugins are being consumed simply by looking at
`dist.ini`. And you can tell **exactly** what their configuration is and their intended
order is.

So if you're hacking on one of my dists and a plugin or two get in your way and you're
_wanting_ to work with the full `Dist::Zilla` stack, you can freely just yank them out
and keep on trucking without having to memorize the arcane syntax my bundle requires.

### Doing Long-Term dist ini patches

If you find yourself wanting to make and submit long term changes to dist.ini, **then**
you _may_ want to look into `dist.ini.meta`, and see the results of your changes
in `dist.ini` after making changes by performing:

    dzil bakeini

This will possibly require installing the following, which are not strictly required for
building my dists:

    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::KENTNL
    Dist::Zilla::App::Command::bakeini
